      <txt><![CDATA[CPSID is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies households across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSID index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, a household will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. CPSID Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSID is available elsewhere.

CPSID may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. Users should note that ASEC oversample households (as indicated by ASECOVERH) will always have a CPSID value of 0.

Users may also want to see CPSIDP for more information about linking individuals across time using a person-specific version of CPSID.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HHINTYPE is a household-level variable indicating whether members of the household were interviewed and, if not, why no interview took place.  Type A nonresponse households represent housing units suitable for inclusion in the survey whose residents were not interviewed for reasons such as refusal to participate and temporary absence.  Type B nonresponse households were vacant or were occupied by persons ineligible for interview (e.g., institutionalized persons).  Type C nonresponse households were housing units that were demolished, converted to storage or business use, or included in the sample by mistake.

Sampling for the CPS is based on housing units (addresses) rather than persons.  For this reason, interviewers necessarily initially visit some unoccupied or uninhabitable dwellings.  Participation in the survey is voluntary, rather than required by law, and institutionalized persons are intentionally excluded.]]></txt>

      <labl>Household replicate weights</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[REPWT provides 160 separate household-level weights that allow users to generate empirically derived standard errors. Person-level replicate weights are available in REPWTP; the household-level replicate weights have been taken from the person-level replicate weights of the reference person.  

More information about replicate weight creation and use is available on the IPUMS-CPS replicate weights FAQ page and in the Census Bureau's "Estimating ASEC Variances with Replicate Weights" document.

Calculating the standard error of an estimate enables the construction of a confidence interval around the sample estimate of interest and may also be used in hypothesis testing. In theory, the standard error of an estimate measures the variation of a statistic across multiple samples of a given population. Researchers can use replicate weights to mirror this theoretical approach when only sample data is available, and the resulting standard errors have a higher degree of precision than standard asymptotic standard errors. 

The 2005-onward CPS samples contain 160 replicate weights at the person level (variables named REPWTP1 through REPWTP160). For self-representing strata (i.e., areas with populations large enough to be represented with certainty in the sample), the replicate weights were produced using what is known as the successive difference replication (SDR) method.  For non-self-representing strata (areas that are not represented with certainty in the sample), the replicate weights were produced using the modified half-sample technique.  Both methods involve repeated implementations of the initial (full-sample) weighting algorithm, such that full information about the CPS sample is available in the replicate weights.  Nevertheless, users should use these replicate weights only for generating variance estimates, not for obtaining unique parameter estimates.  

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in March using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the March 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Weights and SPM Archive.

User Note: The successive difference replication approach (SDR) is different from other methods for creating replicate weights such as balanced repeated replication (BRR) and jackknife estimation, and standard statistical software packages have no built-in method to handle them. However, Stata's jackknife standard error program can be adapted to calculate replicate standard errors for CPS data; see the IPUMS-CPS replicate weights FAQ for details.

Additionally, it is possible for replicate weights to take negative values for certain cases; again, users should use these weights only for variance estimation purposes and not to obtain independent estimates.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[CPSIDP is an IPUMS CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0. For further information about the relationship between the March Basic and the ASEC, please see our additional documentation.]]></txt>

      <labl>Annual Social and Economic Supplement Weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls. IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights.]]></txt>

      <labl>Weekly earnings (rounded)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EARNWEEK2 reports how much the respondent usually earned per week at their current job, before deductions, rounded to preserve privacy. In April 2023, the Census Bureau began rounding weekly earnings as a privacy protection measure. EARNWEEK2 imposes these rounding criteria on pre-April 2023 data to provide users with comparable weekly earnings over time. See the Census Bureau's user note for more information on the new privacy protection measures. EARNWEEK reports un-rounded weekly earnings for pre-April 2023 data only.

Note that rounding of earnings is part of a set of changes made to preserve respondent privacy that began to be phased in with the MISH 1 group in January of 2023. April of 2023 is the first month in which this MISH group is asked earnings questions. Because of Census Bureau's phased approach to introducing these privacy protection measures, only MISH 4 groups in April 2023 - March of 2024 Basic Monthly samples are rounded and topcoded by the Census Bureau. In these months, IPUMS applies the new rounding rules to the MISH 8 group so that all records have comparable values within months. Users wishing to access a variable in which MISH 4 is rounded and MISH 8 remains unrounded should use UH_ERNWK_B5.

Respondents reporting earnings between $0.01 and $7 have weekly earnings set at $4. Those who report $7.01-$1,199.00 have their weekly earnings values rounded to the nearest $2. Weekly earnings between $1,199.01 and $1,999.00 are rounded to the nearest $10. Finally, weekly earnings at or above $2,000.00 are rounded to the nearest $20. For further information about the changes to earnings data beginning in April 2023 and rounding examples, see the Census Bureau's user note.

Interviewers asked directly about total weekly earnings and collected information about the usual number of hours worked per week and the hourly rate of pay at the current job. The figure given in EARNWEEK2 is the higher of the values derived from these two sources: 1) the respondent's answer to the question, "How much do you usually earn per week at this job before deductions?" or 2) for workers paid by the hour (and coded as "2" in PAIDHOUR), the reported number of hours the respondent usually worked at the job, multiplied by the hourly wage rate given in HOURWAGE, and rounded as described above.

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer, users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors. Researchers should use the EARNWT weight with this variable.

      <txt><![CDATA[HOURWAGE2 reports how much the respondent earned per hour in the current job, for those workers paid an hourly wage (and coded as "2" in PAIDHOUR).  Beginning in April 2023, hourly earnings were rounded and topcodes were changed as a privacy protection measure. HOURWAGE2 imposes these criteria on pre-April 2023 data to provide users with comparable hourly earnings over time.

Users wishing to access a variable in which MISH 4 is rounded and MISH 8 remains unrounded should use UH_ERNHR_B2.

Those reporting hourly earnings between $0.01 and $0.07 are set to $0.05; hourly earnings between $0.08 and $29.99 are rounded to the nearest $0.05; hourly earnings between $30.00 and $49.99 are rounded to the nearest $0.25; hourly earnings $50.00 or higher are rounded to the nearest $0.50. For further information about the changes to earnings data beginning in April 2023 and rounding examples, see the Census Bureau's user note.

With the new rounding scheme, it is no longer possible to identify which persons are earning less than the Federal minimum wage using hourly earnings. To preserve this information, the new variable SUBMINWAGE has been introduced to flag these individuals.

Amounts are expressed as they were reported to the interviewer with rounding applied as described above; users must adjust for inflation using Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.  Researchers should use the EARNWT weight with this variable.

Users should note that HOURWAGE2 has two implied decimal places. The command files provided by IPUMS divide HOURWAGE2 by 100, so no further alteration is necessary.

      <txt><![CDATA[RELATE reports an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder.

CPS interviewers collected detailed information about the precise relationships of all persons in the household in their initial listing of household members.  Unfortunately, they then simplified the detailed data (e.g., daughter-in-law, lodger's brother) by coding it into a few broad categories (e.g., "other relative of head," "nonrelative of head with own relatives in household") specified on the interview form.  Only the broad categories are preserved in the data.  The 4-digit codes for RELATE are consistent with the coding scheme used in IPUMS-USA census data.]]></txt>

Note that FAMSIZE is an IPUMS-derived variable using IPUMS-derived family interrelationships, which will not necessarily correspond to the Census Bureau's family definitions. See FTYPE, FAMKIND, and FAMREL for variables that correspond to Census family units. IPUMS does not currently offer a corresponding variable for the size of the Census family unit, but variables necessitating this information such as POVERTY already take the Census family unit size into account.

An Introduction to the Family Interrelationship Variables can be found on IPUMS-USA. On this page you'll find information on how IPUMS family interrelationship variables are constructed, common uses of these variables, and specific examples of how these variables can be used efficiently.]]></txt>

      <labl>Relationship to family</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[FAMREL states the person's relationship to their Census-defined subfamily unit. The Census subfamily type is identified in FTYPE. Values of Census family-level variables such as FTOTVAL are valid for the respective subfamily unit.

Note that IPUMS and the Census Bureau define subfamilies differently. Subfamilies in IPUMS CPS can be identified using the variables MOMLOC, POPLOC and SPLOC. Any subfamilies identified using these variables are not necessarily the same as any Census subfamilies. The IPUMS-defined variable FAMUNIT identifies families according to IPUMS rules (not Census rules), but does not identify (related) subfamilies. FAMREL and FTYPE refer to Census-defined subfamilies. See here for a description of IPUMS subfamilies and their relation to Census subfamilies. IPUMS CPS does not currently offer IPUMS subfamily identifiers such as IPUMS USA's SUBFAM. Below is a brief description of the Census family/subfamily concept as it concerns FAMREL.

Each CPS household has one person designated as the householder, who is the person in whose name the housing unit is rented or own. The CPS splits households into family, subfamily, and individual units. The primary family is the householder and everyone related to the householder. For the purposes of FAMREL and FTYPE, and following some CPS documentation, "primary family" will be used as shorthand for "primary family only", or the householder and his/her immediate family: that is, the primary family less any subfamily units. In addition to the primary family, a household can also contain subfamily units related to the primary family (related subfamily, or subfamily units that are extended family to the householder), as well as unrelated subfamily units, which are immediate family units with no relation to the householder. Additionally, the household can contain individuals who are not part of any family/subfamily unit, such as guests, boarders, or individual resident employees (i.e. those not living with the resident employee's family). Finally, the householder can also be someone without any relatives in the household, and so is not part of any family unit. More details on the family composition of households and the official CPS definitions can be found in the description for FTYPE. 

For the purposes of FAMREL, each subfamily (including the "primary family only" subfamily) has a reference person. Thus the "reference person" for FAMREL can be in the primary family or any other subfamily unit. (Note that in some CPS documentation the term "reference person" refers to the householder only; FAMREL, which is based on the CPS variable PRFAMREL/A-FAMREL, uses the term slightly differently). 

Note that since FAMREL gives the relationship to the subfamily unit, which may not be the entire household, the relationship given by FAMREL is not necessarily the same as the individual's relationship to the householder (RELATE). Thus, for example, a grandchild of the household head could be the reference person of a related subfamily. Additionally, since FAMUNIT is IPUMS-derived and also does not identify related subfamilies, the family identified by FAMUNIT will be different from the subfamily unit that FAMREL refers to. 

Since FAMREL identifies the way in which the individual is related to the subfamily unit, for most years a child (FAMREL=3) can be of any age, and if under 18 can be or have been married. "Not a family member" refers to nonfamily householders or individuals unrelated to any subfamily units in the family (secondary individuals).]]></txt>

      <labl>Employment status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. The variable also provides information on the activity (e.g., doing housework, attending school,) or status (e.g., retired, unable to work) of persons not in the labor force, as well as limited additional information on those who are in the labor force (e.g. members of the Armed Forces, those with a job, but not at work last week). See LABFORCE for a dichotomous variable identifying whether a person participated in the labor force.

In the CPS, individuals' employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week.  Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as "at work."  Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading "has job, not at work last week."

Because the CPS is designed to measure unemployment in the civilian population, the original employment status variable in the survey classifies members of the armed forces as NIU (Not in universe).

Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force.  Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and either reported looking for work as their major activity during the previous week (for 1962 through 1993) or answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. A separate CPS variable specifying whether an unemployed person had worked before or was looking for a first job was used to distinguish between "experienced" and "inexperienced" unemployed persons in IPUMS CPS.

Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, "not in labor force."  Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).]]></txt>

"Industry" refers to the work setting and economic sector, while "occupation" relates to the worker's specific technical function.
  
For persons who were employed at the time of the survey, IND relates to the industrial sector in which the respondent worked during the preceding week.  For unemployed persons and those not currently in the labor force, IND characterizes the industrial sector of the respondent's most recent job.   The CPS interviewer collected information by asking what kind of work the person was doing, and Census Bureau staff coded the information into the CPS or census industrial classification.  Researchers who wish to work with a consistent industrial coding scheme for 1968 forward should use the IND1950 variable.

      <labl>Tax filer status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[FILESTAT reports the federal income tax filing status (single, married filing jointly, head of household, and non-filer) for individuals.  For joint filers, the response categories are further determined by age (over 65 years of age, or younger than 65, for one or both of the filers).  

Under IRS rules, an individual's tax filing status is partly determined by marital status on the last day of the year.  Unmarried persons and those who are legally separated or divorced, and who do not qualify for another filing status, must file as single.  With a few exceptions (i.e., those who were still married but who lived apart from their spouse for at least half the year), head of household filing status is reserved for persons who were not married and who paid for over half the cost of maintaining a home that also housed a dependent unmarried child, grandchild, or dependent parent.  Users should note that the "head of household" value for FILESTAT is not synonymous with identification as the household reference person in the RELATE (Relationship to head of household) variable.

FILESTAT, like other tax-related variables included in the ASEC CPS (ADJGINC, CAPGAIN, CAPLOSS, EITCRED, FEDRETIR, FEDTAX, FICA, MARGTAX, STATETAX, TAXINC, and household level variable PROPTAX) was not determined by direct questioning of respondents.  Rather, values for these variables come from the Census Bureau's tax model, which simulates individual tax returns to produce estimates of federal, state, and payroll taxes.  The model incorporates information from non-CPS sources, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income series, the American Housing Survey, and the State Tax Handbook.  For more information about the model, see Current Population Reports, Series P60-18RD.  The IPUMS-CPS staff welcomes further information from users about the interpretation of this variable or other tax-related variables in the ASEC CPS.]]></txt>

The term "covered by private insurance" in the direct question posed to respondents is ambiguous; coverage might mean either being a private insurance policyholder or having coverage as a dependent via someone else's private insurance policy.  Because some respondents interpreted the question in the former, narrower sense, the identification of persons covered by private insurance (either as policyholders or as dependents) via the Bureau's allocation program in COVERPI is more complete than the private health insurance coverage reported in PHINSUR.]]></txt>
